A tool for drawing pixelated glycans.

Reasons to pixelate glycans:
* Drawings are in the form of small numpy arrays.
* Can be used as inputs for machine learning.
* Represent all the information in a glycan's IUPAC.
* Drawing board size and centre positions insure perfect alignment.
* They look really cool. =)

The following elements are available for drawing:
